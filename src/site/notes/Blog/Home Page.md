## Blog Stack
If you're looking at this site and saying wow so super cool and awesome, you may want to check out the Digital Garden Community Plugin for Obsidian.

I can do a writeup for this if the demand is there, however their [docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) are pretty thorough so check that out first
